All files contain very simple and easy to read code and it is DRY. 
Design and style meets all the requirements and conventions. (PEP8) 
Logic is easy to understand and it is clear what the code is doing.
Nice job putting the doc string in some of your functions.
You can easily install package in colab notebook and use module with no issues.

What to improve: 
You can add doc string to your classes as well and some comments would be nice.
And also you can add instructions on how import and use your module.

In general great job! 3 stars!
